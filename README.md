In this crash course I take you through the basic of Jquery moving from Javascript's perspective.

## What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.



The jQuery library contains the following features:

* HTML/DOM manipulation
- CSS manipulation
- HTML event methods
- Effects and animations
- AJAX
- Utilities

## Jquery Syntax

Normal javascript : '*document.querySelector({element})'
Jquery syntax: All you need to do is to add {$} symbol and brackets {()} then the element
  - e.g $('{element name}')


Enjoy!
